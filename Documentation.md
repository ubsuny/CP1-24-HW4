In 1929, paper titled " A relation between Diatance and Radial Velocity among extra-Galactic Nebulae" explored 
the relationship between the distances of galaxies and their radial velocities [1]. Edwin Hubble classified galaxies
into nine groups based on their distances and redshifts.
## Backgrounf information
### *Cepheid Variable stars as Distance Indicator:
To determine the distances of galaxies, Hubble used Cepheid variable stars, which vary in brightness in a regular
and predictable way [2]. Henrietta Swan Leavitt had previously discovered a correlation between a Cepheid's brightness
and its pulsation period, providing a reliable way to calculate distances. By identifying Cepheid stars in nearby
galaxies, Hubble was able to calculate their absolute brightness and by comparing it to the apparent brightness, 
derive an approximate distance to each galaxy.
### * Redshift and Doppler Effect for measuring Radial Velocity:
Hubble measured the redshift of light from each galaxy, a phenomenon caused by the Doppler effect, which causes
light from receding objects to shift toward longer (redder) wavelengths. The radial velocity of galaxies could
thus be inferred from the degree of redshift. Hubble also utilized data from astronomer Vesto Melvin Slipher,
who had spent years collecting redshift information for various galaxies.
## Selection of Nine Groups
### * Grouping Based on Distance Ranges [3]:
Hubble created these nine groups by organizing galaxies in ranges of increasing distance from Earth. He did
this to make a clear comparison between the radial velocities (redshifts) and the distances. Each group
represented a set of galaxies within a similar distance range, allowing him to observe whether galaxies in
each group had consistent redshift characteristics.
### * Grouping Based on Pattern of Increasing Redshift with Distance:
By plotting the radial velocity against distance for each group, Hubble noticed a clear trend: the farther
a galaxy was, the higher its redshift meaning it was moving away from Earth at a faster speed
The Linear Relationship: Hubble’s Law
Through these nine groupings, Hubble found that there was a roughly linear relationship between distance
and velocity, which he formulated as:
**$\displaystyle{v}={H}_{{0}}\cdot{d}$**
where:
v is the radial velocity (redshift) of a galaxy,
d is the distance to the galaxy,
$\displaystyle{H}_{{0}}$ is the constant of proportionality, now known as the Hubble constant.
### Significance of the Nine Groups
### * Evidence of Expansion:
By showing a consistent increase in velocity with distance across nine groups, Hubble provided
some of the first empirical evidence that the universe was expanding.
### * Establishing a Standard for Cosmology:
His approach laid the foundation for estimating distances to far-off galaxies, measuring the
universe’s expansion rate, and supporting theories about the Big Bang.
### * The Hubble Constant and Modern Cosmology:
His work set off decades of research into measuring the exact rate of expansion, which is
critical for estimating the age, size, and ultimate fate of the universe [4].
